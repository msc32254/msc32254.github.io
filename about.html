                <i>Unlisted</i> considers the unexpected encounters of nine
                third-year MFA candidates from the Lamar Dodd School of Art.
                The exhibition playfully references the mundane strangeness
                of Craigslist postings, a site notorious for its niches,
                where serendipitous meetings and missed connections are
                equally valid.

                With a range of interdisciplinary work–from objects and
                garments to text, images, and prints–the curation plays
                happenstance against intention. Accumulation and proximity
                reveal alignments, as the artists engage with the looming
                urgencies of planetary crises, the complexities of
                connection in the digital age, and the wonder of ecological
                systems.

            <a>
                The pop up exhibition’s provisional space echoes the time of
                passage that the artists currently share, while its
                informality channels the impromptu mundanity of the listings
                forum. Viewers are invited into an installation in which
                craft, absurdity, mystery, disaster, and nostalgia swirl
                around one another. Rather than an advertisement,
                <i>Unlisted</i> proposes an open-ended space of possibility
                predicated on looking for the unlikely. <br />
