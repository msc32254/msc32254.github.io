                    <i>Unlisted</i> considers the unexpected encounters of nine
                    third-year MFA candidates from the Lamar Dodd School of Art.
                    The exhibition playfully references the mundane strangeness
                    of Craigslist postings, a site notorious for its niches,
                    where serendipitous meetings and missed connections are
                    equally valid.

                <a>
                    With a range of interdisciplinary work–from objects and
                    garments to text, images, and prints–the curation plays
                    happenstance against intention. Accumulation and proximity
                    reveal alignments, as the artists engage with the looming
                    urgencies of planetary crises, the complexities of
                    connection in the digital age, and the wonder of ecological
                    systems.

                    The pop up exhibition’s provisional space echoes the time of
                    passage that the artists currently share, while its
                    informality channels the impromptu mundanity of the listings
                    forum. Viewers are invited into an installation in which
                    craft, absurdity, mystery, disaster, and nostalgia swirl
                    around one another. Rather than an advertisement,
                    <i>Unlisted</i> proposes an open-ended space of possibility
                    predicated on looking for the unlikely. <br />
