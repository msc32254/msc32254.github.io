                <a>
                    I’m interested in human-made objects, the peculiar ways that
                    we arrange matter to meet our needs. My work is an
                    exploration of the functionality of the objects that we use
                    in our lives, by asking “if I remove the functionality of an
                    everyday object, does it turn into an art object?” I
                    undermine the key purpose of a given object, through
                    material or functional transformation, resulting in
                    something dysfunctional and absurd.

                    The ‘art object’ is generally regarded as the antithesis of
                    the ‘functional object’; the ‘art object’ is to be looked at
                    but not used. I juxtapose the paradigms of ‘art object’ and
                    ‘functional object’ to find out what lies in between in the
                    blurry no-mans-land. My work distills the aesthetic and
                    function from an object, plays with these two aspects, and
                    recombines them into new forms.

                <a>
                    I bring the approach of ‘user-centered-design’ to art. This
                    process, used to design products and software for consumers,
                    is hyper-focused on the experience of the end user: making
                    the product as efficient and convenient as possible. Unlike
                    typical user-centered-design, which iterates on products to
                    create the optimal experience or outcome, I am instead
                    designing for an experience that could be absurd,
                    inefficient, or surprising. When designing, I ask myself
                    “what characteristics or design choices are fundamental to
                    its purpose? What happens when I adjust these variables?” I
                    want to amplify function to the point of futility, to poke
                    fun at the sisyphean/capitalist desire for ever more
                    utility. I create anti-ergonomic objects, I design for a
                    non-user, I am an advocate against convenience.
