                    Meredith Emery is an interdisciplinary artist born in North
                    Carolina and is currently a second year MFA Candidate at the
                    University of Georgia. Emery works across sculpture,
                    photography, print media, sound, and performance to
                    investigate environmental concerns alongside collective
                    systems of value, learning, and labor. She received her BFA
                    in Studio Art from the University of North Carolina at
                    Chapel Hill and has exhibited regionally in the southeastern
                    US. She has been a resident at the Hambidge Center for
                    Creative Arts, and a student at the John C. Campbell Folk
                    School, as well as Penland School of Craft.
